The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can lead to unexpected results if used improperly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` on an element that has a parent element that doesn't have a defined width can cause the element to not render correctly or unexpectedly overflow. This is because `100%` refers to the parent element's width, and if that's not defined, the calculation will be flawed.
